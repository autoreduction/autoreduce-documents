General discussion points
=========================

* We need to encourage use of autoreduce@reduce.isis.cclrc.ac.uk. Maybe have a rota for checking it during cycle or otherwise. This is to avoid the case we had recently where Pascal emailed Elliot directly while he was on holiday. Perhaps better we should have all emails to this addressed forwarded to slack? We have relevative few emailed to this address: some nagios, a couple from Simon and a few reduce.py script error message. I suggest that we don't have reduce.py script errors emailed since they should be fixed by instrument scientists, but otherwise stuff send to this address 

* Move to `pymysql` over `MySQL-Python` initial investigation shows that the API is very similar (if not identical) for basics. Main difference is that `pymysql` is python only so don't hvae to worry about compiling bugs we have seen in the past with `MySQL-Python`
  * Seem to have alot of MYSQL libraries - we should investigate if we can reduce the number we use (if they are all required then we should document them better)

* Quite a few PRs building up that require review

* failed POLARIS run http://reduce.isis.cclrc.ac.uk/runs/POLARIS/112998/0/
