### Previous sprint retrospective
* **Estimated points:** 40
* Review tickets
* **Actual:** 
  * Complete: 12
  * Open PRs: 9
  * In progress (No PR): 11
  * Backlog: 8

* **Feedback:**
  * How did we do vs. estimates?
    * Under achieved: 
      * Poor scrum leading - need to ensure that arising issues are dealt with in a  better way (take off product owner hat in scrum meetings)
      * Elliot took on too much to quickly (lots of push back on PRs)
      * Push back from previous PR not part of the sprint that took developer/tester time
      * 
  * Any particularly challenging issues?
    * System test issue (Should have been broken up / more carefully considered)
