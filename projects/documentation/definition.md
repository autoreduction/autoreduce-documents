####Description
In order to lessen the burden on instrument scientists and the development team when on boarding users,
it is important to have good quality documentation to guide users through the system. Ideally, users
should be able to use the autoreduction system with very minimal help from others and instead rely on the 
documentation. Documentation should be concise and fit the target audience e.g. developer / user / admin
documentation should be separated.

####Requirements / use cases
* It must be possible to understand the functionality of the Autoreduction system as a user from the provided documentation
* The documentation should be split up to allow users / instrument scientist / developers access to the information they need easily
* The documentation should be integrated into the web application
* The documentation should be given in different media types where appropriate e.g. text, interactive guide, video

#### User groups
* System Admins
* Developers
* Instrument Scientists
* Users

#### Break down of feature
1. Review existing documentation for validity and fit for purpose
2. Create a list of components to document and how granular the documentation should be for each user group
3. Establish the correct media to use for the different levels of documentation
4. 

#### Outputs
* Documentation matrix explaining what documentation is available to who and how granular it is
* The actual documentation matching the requirements specified in the above matrix

#### Considerations
* How do we deal with changes to the documentation when the system changes?
